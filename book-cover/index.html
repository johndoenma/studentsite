                            <h3>Project Description</h3>
                            <p>I was tasked with designing a book cover for a Podcast Episode from the series "This
                                Is Love." The episode I chose was One in A Million, a story about living life at your
                                own&nbsp;pace.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Brand Strategy</h3>
                            <p>The first book I designed, One in a Million, was the basis for my two other book
                                cover designs to keep the trilogy cohesive. After exploring different mediums,
                                production techniques, and layouts, I decided to use a combination of typography and
                                photography for my book covers. The photo on the cover is small while the title is very
                                large. The contrast in size is meant to pique interest and also give the book title the
                                opportunity to speak for the story with its own unique type consideration and treatment.
                                Each book cover has a different color to let the mood of the story shine&nbsp;through.

                                visually
                                interesting way to express the concept from my sketches.</p>

                            <p>My artistric exloration birthed 3 viable options for my individual book cover.
                                However,
                                the final book cover was decided
                                in consideration cohesivenss and feasability for a larger trilogy.</p>
